# Learning-Cuis
Quick-UI-Tour

Greetings and Welcome!!

This file is a quick tour of the Cuis User Interface (UI).

Smalltalk defined Object Oriented.  All computation is done by objects sending messages to themselves and each other.

Cuis shares with other Smalltalk implementations the characteristic that all objects are live.  All objects can be inspected and changed while they are executing.

There are many great tools waiting to be used.  This tour gives an introduction to a few  of the most important ones.

Perhaps the best way to think of Cuis is as a playground.

You can open a Cuis image using a protable virtual machine and see the same windows in the same positions pixel-per-pixel on Linux, Macintosh, Windows or any operating system where the VM runs.

You can start an image, do things with it and throw it away or save the image and a record of the changes to be opened another time and take up right where you left off.
