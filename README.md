# Learning-Cuis
Cuis-Smalltalk-Learning

Greetings and Welcome!!

This project is all about learning Cuis and sharing Cuis code which others may find of interest.

The basic goals here are to develop a strategy which is
- Easy to contribute to
- Orienting and useful to people learning Cuis/Smalltalk
- Simple enough that we will bother to maintain it and not step (often) on each others feet.

The gist is that we, the Cuis community,  maintain an overview page, then just _fork_ our own mature/example projects (e.g. Cuis-Smalltalk-ColorEditor) where each has/adds its own explanation about what is interesting to learn there.  Each contributed project adds an author to the repository who is responsible for keeping his/her stuff up to date and supplying an orienting overview for learning.

Each Project should supply a 'RoughGuide.md', which talks what the interesting bits of code are, as well as the Project 'README.md' which should
- Name the project/feature(s) -- what is this good for, what does it do?
- List the latest Cuis version+revision the code was tested with.
- Have the Smalltalk code to load the package(s).
- Have useful code/usage examples.
- Optionally, show a screen graphic (what does this look like?)

For an example. look at the Cuis-Smalltalk-ColorEditor repository.

ToDo:

-  Using the Styled Text Editor, we start and maintain a Rough Guide to Cuis (Cuis-by-Example).  After the general Smalltalk and Cuis overviews, we can write about parts of the system, patterns of how to get things done, and use forked project examples.

I suspect it would not be too much work to embed Smalltalk WorkSheets (TerseGuide WorkSpaces) as objects in STE, which would allow us to have nice live examples.  Projects could contribute chapters.
